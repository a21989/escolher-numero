"escolher-numero" (escolher número), "choose number" in portuguese, is a **command-line program** \([*command-line interface*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) – CLI\) implemented in [**C#**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), [**Go**](https://golang.org/) and [**Python**](https://www.python.org/).

## Download

See the [releases][releases] tab.

## Origin

This software is inspired on a smartphone app used by my *Biology and Geology* teacher. He used the app to generate random numbers which would determine the students who would answer some (usually three) questions related to the subject.

## Software capabilities

This program is capable of **generating random numbers** and **flipping a coin** (which is the same as random numbers but with other names and just two numbers (heads and tails)).
