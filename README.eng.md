"escolher-numero" (escolher número), "choose number" in portuguese, is a **command-line program** \([*command-line interface*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) – CLI\) written in [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) and [**Go**](https://golang.org/).

## Origin

The software was inspired on an smartphone app used by my *Biology and Geology* teacher. He uses the app to generate random numbers that will determine the students who will answer some (usually three) questions related to the subject.

## Software capabilities

This program is able to **generate random numbers** and **flip a coin** (which is the same as random numbers but with other names and just two numbers (heads and tails)).

## Development history

The version in Python was the first to be developed and only then came the version in Go. I decided to try to create a version in Go, due to this language being compiled to binary code, which allows an **easier software distribution**. On the other side, Python is an interpreted language, that is interpreted by an "interpreter" at run-time. It is possible to obtain binary files from programs written in Python but the language was not made for that, due to it being dynamic, therefore it is necessary to be compiled by non-official software, while Go has an official compiler.
